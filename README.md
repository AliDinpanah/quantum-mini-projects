# Quantum Computing Algorithms and Operations

This repository contains implementations of key quantum computing algorithms and operations using Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`). The project serves as an educational resource for understanding and applying fundamental quantum techniques.

## Overview

Quantum computing offers a new paradigm of computation based on the principles of quantum mechanics. This repository includes implementations and explanations of:

- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
- Phase Shift Operation
- Grover's Search Algorithm
- Binary Shift Operations
- Quantum Addition with CNOT gates
